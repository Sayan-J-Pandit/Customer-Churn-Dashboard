 # Customer Churn Analysis

 
## Author: Sayan Pandit


 This project analyzes customer churn for a telecommunications company, identifying key factors contributing to churn and providing data-driven recommendations to reduce it. The analysis is designed to be easily understood by a non-technical audience.


 ## Objectives 

* **Identify Reasons for Churn:** Uncover the primary drivers behind customer attrition. 

* **Provide Recommendations:** Suggest actionable strategies to minimize churn based on data insights. 


## Data Source 

The dataset used for this analysis is publicly available and can be found at the following locations: 

* [IBM Telco Customer Churn on ICP4D](https://github.com/IBM/telco-customer-churn-on-icp4d/tree/master) 

* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)


 The data was prepared using a combination of tools to ensure clarity and consistency. 

**Tools Used:** 

* Excel 
* Power Query (within Power BI) 
* Power BI 
* ChatGPT (for assistance with One DAX measures) 


**Excel Data Cleaning:** 
Several columns were simplified in Excel for easier interpretation: 

* **Senior Citizen:** "Yes" was replaced with "Senior Citizen", and "No" was replaced with "Adult". 

* **Partner:** "Yes" was replaced with "Partnered", and "No" was replaced with "Single". 

These replacements were done using Excel's **Find & Replace (selecting a column, Ctrl + F â†’ Replace All)** functionality. 


**Power BI Data Transformation (Power Query):** 

Further data cleaning and feature engineering were performed in Power BI using Power Query: 

* **Churn:** "Yes" was replaced with "C-Yes", and "No" was replaced with "C-No". This was done using the "Replace Values" option in Power Query.

**New Columns Created:** 

The following new columns were created using custom queries in Power Query: 


***1. Internet Y/N (`Internet Service Indicator`):*** A binary indicator for internet service (Yes/No). Fiber optic and DSL connections were classified as "Yes".
```powerquery 
if [InternetService] = "Fiber optic" then "Yes" 
else if [InternetService] = "DSL" then "Yes" 
else "No" 
```

***2. Number of Services Used:*** A count of the number of services subscribed to by each customer (Streaming Movies, Streaming TV, Tech Support, Online Backup, Online Security, Paperless Billing).
```powerquery
(if [StreamingMovies] = "Yes" then 1 else 0) +
(if [StreamingTV] = "Yes" then 1 else 0) +
(if [TechSupport] = "Yes" then 1 else 0) +
(if [OnlineBackup] = "Yes" then 1 else 0) +
(if [OnlineSecurity] = "Yes" then 1 else 0) +
(if [PaperlessBilling] = "Yes" then 1 else 0)
```
***3. Tenure (in Years) (`Tenure Buckets`):*** Categorized customer tenure into yearly buckets (e.g., "<1 Year", "<2 Years", ..., "6+ Years").
```powerquery
if [Tenure] < 12 then "<1 Year"
else if [Tenure] < 24 then "<2 Years"
else if [Tenure] < 36 then "<3 Years"
else if [Tenure] < 48 then "<4 Years"
else if [Tenure] < 60 then "<5 Years"
else if [Tenure] < 72 then "<6 Years"
else "6+ Years"
```
## Analytics (Power BI Measures)
Used **DAX formulas** to derive key metrics for churn analysis:

#### **%Device Protection**
```DAX
%Device Protection =
DIVIDE(
CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[DeviceProtection]),'01 Churn-Dataset'[DeviceProtection] ="Yes",'01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn] = "C-Yes"),
CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[DeviceProtection]),'01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn] = "C-Yes"),
0)
```
#### **%Having Dependents**
```DAX
%Having Dependents =
DIVIDE(
CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[Dependents]),'01 Churn-Dataset'[Dependents] = "Yes",'01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn] = "C-Yes"),
CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[Dependents]),'01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn] ="C-Yes"),
0)
```

Similar DAX formulas were used for:
- **% Having Dependents**
- **% Having Partner**
- **% Using Internet Service**
- **% Using Multiple Lines**
- **% Using Online Backup**
- **% Using Online Security**
- **% Using Paperless Billing**
- **% Using Phone Service**
- **% Using Streaming Movies**
- **% Using Streaming TV**
- **% Using Tech Support**

#### **Churn Rate Calculation**
This measure calculates the churn percentage dynamically. This formula was initially generated with the aid of ChatGPT (through AI prompting), but contained errors that were subsequently identified and corrected by the author prior to implementation.
```DAX
%Churn = 
VAR TotalCustomers = CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[customerID]), ALL('01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn]))
VAR ChurnedCustomers = CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[customerID]), '01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn] = "C-Yes")
VAR SelectedChurn = SELECTEDVALUE('01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn], "All")  // Default to "All" if nothing is selected

RETURN 
SWITCH(
    SelectedChurn,
    "C-Yes", DIVIDE(ChurnedCustomers, TotalCustomers) * 100,  // % of churned customers
    "C-No", DIVIDE(TotalCustomers - ChurnedCustomers, TotalCustomers) * 100,  // % of non-churned customers
    100  // When "All" is selected, show 100%
)
```

## Dashboard & Visualization

## ðŸ“–Story 
**â€” For Stakeholders Who Prefer Stories with Numbers**  
*(The nature of the story can be changed according to the taste of the target audience)*
```

Let's start this with a number. **26**.

**26%** of customers are found to have left this journey with us.



### What are the features of these 26% customers?

- Almost **75%** of them are **young adults** (non-senior citizens).  
- A staggering **94%** were **internet users**, and **70%** of them were using **fiber optics** as their internet service.  
- **88.55%** of them were on a **month-to-month contract**.  
- Almost **54%** had **joined us less than a year ago**.  
- Close to **58%** had chosen **electronic checks** as their **payment method**.

And thereâ€™s one more thing I'd like to highlight:

- Out of **2955 tech tickets** raised in total, **2173** came from this **26%** population.  
- But when it comes to **Admin tickets**, only **885** out of **3632** were raised by them.



## Now, what does that tell us?  
**Any guesses? Any guesses?**



All these factors point towards one thing:  
ðŸ‘‰ **Issues with the internet service we are providing.**

Yes, there can be small, scattered reasons,  
but the **dominant factor** seems to be something wrong with the **internet service** we provide.



## And why are we so sure about this?

Because when we look at other factorsâ€”  
- Gender  
- Having or not having multiple lines  
- Or any other factor  
   
None of them make a significant difference.  
Every analysis relays the **same statement** again and again.



## So, what can we do with these insights?

This is where we feel the **need for more data**:

- What's the **position of our competitors**?  
- What **offers** are they bringing to the table?  
- What do the **churned customers** say?  
- And what do the **retained customers** say?

Surveys and **customer feedback** will help us design **more informed, targeted solutions**.



## But based on the data we have right now, one thing is clear:

If we **take care of our internet services**  
and make the customer journey more **engaging**, **dynamic**, and **hooking**,  
especially keeping the **age group** and their **preferences** in mind,  
we can make a **big difference**.
